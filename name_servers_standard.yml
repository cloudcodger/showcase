    Showcase configuring standard Bind9 Name Server VMs.
    Considered to be the most beneficial example having all zones use the same host as the primary
    name server and the rest of the hosts as secondaries.
    Where the primary name server is configured using 'host_vars/ns7.yml' and
    all secondary name servers are configured using 'group_vars/ns_vm.yml'.
    Differs from the 'name_servers.yml' playbook, only in that the hosts are VMs and not containers.
    And the 'ansible_user' is 'ubuntu' (QEMU) instead of 'root' (LXC).
  become: true
  hosts: ns_vm

  vars_files:
    - zone_vars/192.168.6.yml
    - zone_vars/lab.yml

  roles:
    - role: cloudcodger.ubuntu.initial_apt_update
